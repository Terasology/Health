# Damage Sound Component

This component is a _configuration component_ that provides a list of sounds for an entity, one of which is to be played when the entity is damaged.

Sounds should be referenced as `[engine|<module>]:<soundFileName>` for sound files located in the `assets/sounds` directory of the engine or a module, for instance `engine:Slime3`.
