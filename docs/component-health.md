# Health Component

This component is a _topic component_ which contains various health-related configuration and state information for an entity.
It can be used to configure maximum health, damage thresholds, and whether or not the entity should be destroyed if its health drops to 0.
The component further informs systems about the entity's current health.

The `Health` component is the main source of health-related data for a variety of systems throughout Terasology.
