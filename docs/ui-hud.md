# Health HUD

The `Health` module extends the Player HUD with a health bar consisting of red hearts.

When you receive damage, you will lose health, visualized by the full hearts being drained from the right to the left.
Once all the hearts in your health bar are empty, you will die.
You start automatically regenerating health over time once you are no longer being damaged.
