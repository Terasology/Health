# Damage Overlay

The `Health` module adds a visual overlay whenever the player is damaged.
If the player hurts themselves, for instance through drowning or fall damage, or is hurt by an effect on them, for instance poison, the default damage overlay is shown.

In case of an external cause, for instance an attacker, the overlay will be directional, indicating the direction of origin of the damage cause.
