# Damage Overlay

The `Health` module adds a visual overlay whenever the you are damaged.
If you hurt yourself (self-inflicted damage), for instance through falling, drowning, or poisoning, the default damage overlay is displayed.
It consists of four red indicators, one on each side of your screen.

In case of an external cause, for instance another player or an NPC attacking you, the overlay will be directional.
There will only be one red indicator, marking the direction of origin of the damage cause.
This will allow you to locate the external cause that is hurting you.
