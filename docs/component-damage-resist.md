# Damage Resist Component

This component is a _configuration component_ and can be used to configure an entity to not take damage from specific damage types. Examples for damage types are drowning (`engine:drowningDamage`) or explosive (`engine:explosiveDamage`) damage.

The `DamageAuthoritySystem` considers the settings provided by this component before an entity is damaged.
