To deactivate particular type of regeneration, send `DeactivateRegenEvent(String id)`. Empty event 
`DeactivateRegenEvent()` deactivates base regeneration fo entity.

* OnFullyHealedEvent (if healed to full health)

## Damage System
Handles damage dealt to entities with health. Send `DoDamageEvent`
to deal damage to entity. 

Event chain:
* DoDamageEvent
* BeforeDamageEvent 
* Entity damaged, health component saved
* OnDamagedEvent

* damageResist(damagetype,percentage): gives resistance to damage (damagetype = all for total resistance).
* damageImmune(damagetype): percentage = 100 by default.
